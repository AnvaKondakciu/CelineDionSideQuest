  <h2 class = "set">My Concert Experience</h2> <br>
  <p style = "color: black;" class = "setp">Last month, I had the pleasure of attending a Celine Dion concert for the first time. Celine Dion is an artist that has built a powerful career through her strong voice and wide vocal range. Her music is not found in the top charts but instead is a mix of classic, English and French harmonies. She is a world-class vocalist with strong range and tireless energy. I have been able to witness many artists perform, and Celine Dion’s four hour vigorous and energetic performance shocked me to my core. No slip-ups, no anxiety, no mistakes. After the concert, I completed some research to figure out more about her story and influence. <br></p>

  <h2 class = "set3"> VULNERABILITY</h2> <br>
  <p style = "color: black;" class = "setp3">
    What makes Celine Dion so distinguishable is her lack of fear in being vulnerable. Her most powerful and memorable songs, My Heart Will Go On, Think Twice, and Because You Loved Me have a lot more impact in her recent performances. After losing her husband four years ago, she continued to perform these songs weeks after his passing. She cried on stage and did not fight her emotions to the public. Celine Dion used her music as a window to her authenticity. When I heard her perform, “My Heart Will Go On”, I felt my hidden emotions escaping. It felt freeing to listen to such a powerful song, and everyone on the stage seemed to share the same feelings. When me and my mother walked back to the subway, over a hundred people around us sang “My Heart Will Go On” at the top of their lungs. It was an amazing moment and I am glad to have witnessed it two weeks before all large gatherings in NYC were banned.  </p>

      <h2 class = "set1">My Heart Will Go On, 1997</h2>
     <p class = "setp1"> Celine Dion remarked how much she disliked recording My Heart Will Go On.
       The director of Titanic, James Cameron, disliked the song just as much as she did.
       This song ended up becoming Dion’s signature and included on her album,
       Let’s Talk About Love which sold over 60 million copies. (Rapkin).  </p>

      <h2 class = "set1">The Power Of Love, 1993 </h2>
     <p class = "setp1">The Power of Love was Celine Dion’s first number one-song, reaching Platinum in
       the United States and Australia. She sang this song in 1993 for President Bill Clinton at Washington, D.C.
        This song remained #1 for a month on Billboard charts and #9 on UK Singles (“Celine Dion”).</p>

      <h2 class = "set1">Because You Loved Me, 1996 </h2>
     <p class = "setp1">This song was one of the two that Celine Dion performed at the Oscars,
        as she became the first musical artist to perform two songs during the Oscars (“Celine Dion About”).
        While often interpreted as a romantic love song, it was actually a tribute to Diane Warren's father.

  <h2 class = "set3"> IN COMPARISON </h2> <br>
  <p style = "color: black;" class = "setp3">
    Celine Dion has a 5-octave vocal range. For most singers, the average vocal range is three octaves, making Celine Dion a powerful vocalist and one of pop music’s most influential voices. For this reason, she is often compared to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston who stand on a similar influence. According to The New York Times, “Ms. Dion...is a belter with a high, thin, slightly nasal, nearly vibratoless soprano and a good-sized arsenal of technical skills. She can deliver tricky melismas, produce expressive vocal catches and sustain long notes without the tiniest wavering of pitch. And as her duets have shown, she is a reliable harmony voice”(Holden). Dion’s singing voice was tender and intimate, which made me much more engaged as I watched her glide from a soothing tone to her full potential.   </p>
